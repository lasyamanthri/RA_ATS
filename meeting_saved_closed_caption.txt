12:31:10 There's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once that one of the things that's contributed to Homo sapiens success as a species is our lack of body here that are hairlessness are nakedness combined with our invention of clothing, gives us the ability
12:31:26 to modulate our body temperature, and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose.
12:31:33 And now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing and it's more than just utility now it's a communication everything that we choose to put on is a narrative a story about where we've been what we're doing, who we want to be.
12:31:48 I was a lonely kid. I didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with and I ended up making a lot of my own play. I made a lot of my own toys. And it began with ice cream.
12:32:00 There was a Baskin Robbins in my hometown, and they serve ice cream from behind the counter on these giant five gallon cardboard tubs and someone told me it was eight years old, someone told me that when they were done with those tubs they washed them
12:32:13 out and they kept them in the back, and if you ask they would give you one that took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage, but I did.
12:32:20 It took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage, but I did. And they did, they gave me when I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub. And I was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material metal ring, top and bottom and I started turning it over in my head and I realized, wait a minute.
12:32:32 My head actually fits inside this thing, I.
12:32:37 Yeah, I cut a hole out, I put some acetate in there, and I made myself a space helmet.
12:32:42 I needed a place to where the space helmet. So I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home I pushed it home and in my parents guest room closet.
12:32:52 I turned it into a spaceship. I started with a control panel out of cardboard, I cut a hole for a radar screen and put a flashlight underneath it to light it, I put a view screen up which I all set off the back wall and this is where I thought I was being
12:33:05 really clever without permission. I painted the back wall of the closet black, and put a star field which I lit up with some Christmas lights.
12:33:14 I found in the attic. And I went on some space missions.
12:33:19 A couple years later, the movie Jaws came, and I was way too young to see it but I was caught up in jaws fever like everyone else in America time.
12:33:27 And there was a store in my town that had a jaws costume in their window and my mom must have overheard me talking about how awesome I thought this costume was because a couple days before Halloween she blew my freaking mind by giving me this jaws custom.
12:33:41 Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope for people of a certain age to complain the kids these days have no idea how good they have it.
12:33:49 But let me just show you a random sampling of entry level kids costumes, you can buy online right now.
12:33:55 And this is the costume. My mom bought for me.
12:34:03 This is a paper thin shark face, and a vinyl big with the poster of jaws on it.
12:34:09 And I loved it.
12:34:12 A couple years later, my dad took me to a film called Oliver, I actually got him to take me to it twice which is no small thing because it is a hard moderated film, but it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs that maybe you want to go see it again.
12:34:26 They help.
12:34:28 It was the armor. The armor and Excalibur was intoxicating the beautiful to me. These were literally Knights in shining mirror polished armor and moreover the nights and Excalibur where their armor everywhere all the time they were at a dinner, they were
12:34:45 it to bed.
12:34:47 I was like are they reading my mind I want to read, I want to wear armor all the time.
12:34:53 And so I went back to my favorite material, the gateway drug for making corrugated cardboard and I made myself a suit of armor replete with the neck shields and a white horse now that I've oversold it here's a picture of the armor that I made.
12:35:14 Now, this is only the first suit of armor I made, inspired by Excalibur a couple of years later, I convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor over about a month.
12:35:26 He graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing and still one of my all time favorite attachment materials pop rivets. We carefully over that month constructed and articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves we drill holes
12:35:40 in the helmet so that I could breathe. And I finished just in time for Halloween and wear it to school now this is the one thing in this talk that I don't have a slide to show you because no photo exists of this armor.
12:35:51 I did wear it to school, there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls. He never found me for reasons that are about to become clear.
12:35:59 There were things I didn't anticipate about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school in third period, math, I was standing in the back of the class and I'm standing in the back of the class because the armor did not allow me to sit down.
12:36:14 This is the first thing I didn't anticipate.
12:36:17 And then my teachers looks at sort of concerned with us and says, Are you feeling okay and I'm thinking, are you kidding my feeling okay I'm wearing a suit of armor.
12:36:26 I am having the time of my and I'm just about to tell her how great I feel when the classroom starts to listen to the left and disappeared down this long tunnel and then I woke up in the nurse's office.
12:36:39 I had passed out from heat exhaustion, wearing the armor. And when I woke up I wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class. I was wondering who took my armor where's my armor.
12:36:51 Okay. Fast forward a whole bunch of years some colleagues of mine and I get hired to make a show for discovery channel called Myth Busters and over 14 years I learned on the job, how to build experimental methodologies, and how to tell stories about them
12:37:04 for TV.
12:37:05 I also learned early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color, and narrative clarity to the stories that we're telling.
12:37:17 And then we do an episode called dumpster diving, and I learned a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.
12:37:26 The episode dumpster diving the question we were trying to answer is, is jumping into a dumpster as safe as the movies would lead you to believe.
12:37:35 So the episode was going to have two distinct parts to it. One was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman into an airbag, and the second was the graduation to the experiment we'd fill a dumpster full of material and we jumped into it.
12:37:47 I wanted to visually separate these two elements and I thought well, for the first part we're training so we should wear sweat suits Okay, Let's put stunt training on the back of the sweat suits, that's for the training, but for the second part I wanted
12:38:01 something really visually striking I know I'll dress as Neo from the matrix.
12:38:06 So I went to Haight Street I bought some beautiful knee high buckle boots, I found a long flowing coat on eBay I got sunglasses which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear and the day of the experiments who comes up and I step out of my car and
12:38:19 this costume and my crew takes a look at me and start suppressing their church giggles. They're like,
12:38:29 and I feel two distinct things at this moment, I feel total embarrassment over the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew that I'm completely into wearing this costume.
12:38:40 But the producer in my mind remind myself that in the high speed shot in slo mo that flowing code is going to look beautiful behind.
12:38:52 Five years in the myth busters run we got invited to appear at San Diego Comic Con I'd known about Comic Con for years and never had time to go. This was the big leagues, this was costuming Mecca people fly in from all over the world to show their amazing
12:39:06 creations on the floor in San Diego and I wanted to participate. I decided that I would put together an elaborate costume that covered me completely and I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic Con anonymously, the costume I chose Hellboy.
12:39:21 That's not my costume that's actually Hellboy.
12:39:24 But I spent months assembling the most screen accurate Hellboy costume I could from the boots to the belt to the pants to the right hand of doom. I found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest, and I put them on.
12:39:36 I even had contact lenses made in my prescription. I wore it onto the floor at Comic Con and I can't even tell you how balls hot, it was in that costume, sweating.
12:39:49 I should have remembered this I'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes and none of it matters because I'm totally in love, not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor but also with the community of other
12:40:04 customers. It's not called costuming at cons Korea's play essentially cosplay means people who dress up as your favorite characters from film and TV and especially anime but it is so much more than that, these aren't just people who find a costume and
12:40:20 put it on. They mash them up. They bend them to their will they change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions. They're super clever and genius, they let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful.
12:40:34 But more than that they were Hurst their costumes at Comic Con or any other con you don't just take pictures of people walking around you actually go up and say hey I like your custom Can I take your picture, and then you give them time to get into their
12:40:46 pose. They've worked hard on their post to make their costume look great for your camera, and it's so beautiful to watch. And I take this to heart and subsequent cons, I learned Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from the dark night, I learned
12:41:02 learned how to be a scary ring right from Lord of the Rings and I actually frightened some children. I learned that hurt but head laugh the Chewbacca does.
12:41:12 And then I dressed up as no face from Spirited Away.
12:41:15 If you don't know about spirited away and it's director homie is lucky, first of all, you're welcome.
12:41:21 This is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite films.
12:41:25 It's about a young girl named hero who gets lost in the spirit world in an abandoned Japanese theme park, and she finds her way back out again with the help of a couple of friends she makes a capture dragon name hukou and a lonely demon name no face know
12:41:40 face is lonely and he wants to make friends and he thinks that the way to do it is by lowering them to him and producing gold in his hand. But this doesn't go very well.
12:41:50 And so he ends up going on a kind of a rampage until she hero saves him rescues him.
12:41:56 So I put together a no face costume.
12:42:00 And I worked on the floor at Comic Con. And I very carefully practiced no faces gestures, I realized I resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.
12:42:10 When people asked to take my picture, I would nod, and I would shyly stand next to them, and they would take the picture, and then I would secret out from behind my robe, a chocolate gold coin, and at the end of the photo process I make it appear for
12:42:26 them.
12:42:46 Oh, like that. And people were freaking out holy crap gold from no face oh my god this is so cool and I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor, it's fantastic.
12:42:37 And about 15 minutes in something happens.
12:42:44 Somebody grabs my hand, and they put a coin back into it, and I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift but now this is one of the coins that I've given away.
12:42:51 I don't know why I keep on going I take some more pictures, and then it happens again.
12:42:58 I understand, I can't see anything inside this costume I can see through the mouth, I can see people's shoes, what they're saying and I can see their feet, but the third time someone gives me back a coin, I want to know what's going on.
12:43:11 So I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view. And what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.
12:43:19 And then it hits me.
12:43:22 It's bad luck to take gold from no face in the film Spirited Away bad luck befalls those who take gold from no face.
12:43:32 This isn't a performer audience relationship. This is cosplay.
12:59:26 We are all of us on that floor injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us. And we're making it our own. We're connecting with something important inside of us.
12:59:38 And the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other.
12:59:44 Thank you.
